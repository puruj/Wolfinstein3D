3D engine is based off of video tutorials from BennyBox on youtube.

This is my second game, watched the tutorials from BennyBox to understand how to make a game with the 3D engine created from tutorials.
After I got comfortable with the code I made my own levels and game mechanics seperate from the tutorials.

To run you need LWJGL 4.3 or higher and also slick-util. These two things should be added on to the build path through external jar, also
set the natives for LWJGL in the build path.
